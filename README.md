# games
This repository contains links to various games that I have deloped (or helped develop):
- **Qteroids** - A solo-asteroids-ripoff project with the goal of learning Qt
- **Spectrum** - A team-puzzle-rainbow-platformer game with unique color mechanics (later we discovered that there exists a game called Hue with similar core mechanics, so we borrowed some ideas from it)
- **doodLbot** - An algorithm-based multiplayer game; A team microservice-mvc project 
- **mines** - A solo-minesweeper-ripoff project with the goal of learning OOP through C# .NET
- **sudoku** - A solo 9x9 sudoku project with the goal of learning recursive game solving algorithms through C# and .NET
